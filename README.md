# Option Pricer
This is an assignment submitted in an HKU fintech master course FITE7405 - Techniques in computational finance taught by Dr. J.R. Zhang.
It is a group work with my two intelligent classmates Anson Leung and Andrew Wong.
We created an option pricer for calculating the price of a list of options:  
  1. European call/put option
  2. Implied volatility calculator
  3. American call/put option
  4. Geometric Asian option
  5. Arithmetic Asian option
  6. Geometric basket option
  7. Arithmetic basket option
  8. KIKO put option
They are mainly developed on closed form formula, Newton's method, and (quasi-) Monte Carlo Simulations.
