# Option Pricer
This is an assignment submitted in an HKU fintech master course FITE7405 - Techniques in computational finance taught by Dr. J.R. Zhang.  
It is a group work with my two awesome classmates Anson Leung and Andrew Wong.   
We created an option pricer for calculating the price of a list of options:  
  1. European call/put option
  2. Implied volatility calculator
  3. American call/put option
  4. Geometric Asian option
  5. Arithmetic Asian option
  6. Geometric basket option
  7. Arithmetic basket option
  8. KIKO put option  
  
They are mainly developed on closed form formula, Newton's method, and (quasi-) Monte Carlo Simulations.  
The files contain our code written in python, final report, Annex to the final report, and a question set.  
  
Code: You can run the code in any python IDE, such as Spyder or Pycharm, and play with it.  
Final report: It contains our analysis on how the parameters affect the option price, and also the decription of functions in the code.  
Annex: It contains the input parameters and thier constraints.  
Question set: It is the original question set given in the course.
